# Technilogy Used :
I applied for the Web challenge,but after i thought why not do both Web and Mobile.
So I Used Nativescript-Vue Framework(Build a Truly Native App Using Web Framework) to make the Mobile Challenge (List Github Repos)

# The Choice of Technologies: 
I'm a fan of VueJS for it's simplicity ,so i looked for a Framework that can use this to make mobile app(similar to React Native)

## Usage

``` bash
#Requirements :
Node.js
NativeScript CLI : npm install -g nativescript
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
tns build <platform> --bundle

# Build, watch for changes and debug the application
tns debug <platform> --bundle

# Build, watch for changes and run the application
tns run <platform> --bundle
```
